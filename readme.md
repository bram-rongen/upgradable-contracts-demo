# Readme

This repo demos the functionality open zeppelin offers to upgrade contracts.

to run you need to have [ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) running on port 7545 and then run:

```
npm install
node index.js
```

That's it for this small little demo..

I'll create a version that doesn't use the sdk but plain web3 and the contracts from OZ.
